# Text Editor configurations
Just a collection of my own personal Neovim configurations I use as a former visual studio code user.

I will probably change the name soon and include just general text editor configurations as I am looking into emacs, obsidian and possible creating my own text editor.

This repository is mainly to help me use these configurations across systems and also help anyone else wanting to get started I will add some images when I am on a system with more of a head currently I am using debian 13 with a manual i3 setup and I have no idea how to screenshot.
